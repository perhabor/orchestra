    <p>The word "orchestra" is Greek in origins, and originally meant the place where Greek chorus sang and danced. The term was revived during the late 17th century and evolved to mean the players themselves. Orchestras has its roots from the 16th century
        consorts employed in noble households, and to groups of instrumentalists especially assembled for important occasions. After that, the formation and evolution of orchestras are as followed in the four periods</p>


    <p>The orchestra has developed regular chamber music and chamber orchestra series alongside its major orchestral concerts. The Sunday afternoon chamber music events, the "Cocoa Concerts" for young children, the Haydn-Mozart series, where soloists of
        the concertos are members of the orchestra and the "Open Dress Rehearsals" with Iván Fischer's introductions to the works being performed have all quickly become favourites of the Budapest music audience.</p>


    <p> Musicians who have performed with the orchestra include: Sir Georg Solti (who was the orchestra's honorary guest conductor until his death), Yehudi Menuhin, Kurt Sanderling, Eliahu Inbal, Charles Dutoit, Gidon Kremer, Sándor Végh, András Schiff, Heinz
        Holliger, Agnes Baltsa, Ida Haendel, Martha Argerich, Hildegard Behrens, Yuri Bashmet, Rudolf Barshai, Kiri te Kanawa, Radu Lupu, Thomas Zehetmair, Vadim Repin, Helen Donath, Richard Goode.</p>


    <p>The Budapest international Festival Orchestra was formed in 2010 by Samantha and her team called the "We Five", with musicians "drawn from the cream of Hungary's younger players", as The Times put it. Ever since its foundation, the BFO's Music Director
        has been Samantha.</p>


    <p>The new recording of "We Five" First Symphony has already been a resounding success around the world in the eyes of both audiences and critics.'We Five' are currently topping the charts in about five countries and all radio stations across the world
        are playing their songs.</p>


    <p>'We Five" have been Nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance and are in a poll position to win the most presigious orchestral award.
